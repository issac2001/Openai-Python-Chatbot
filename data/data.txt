Welcome to Toc H 
Toc H Institute of Science and Technology, established in 2002, located in the suburbs of Kochi, embellished with dynamic management, diligent and dedicated faculty, and promising cream of the student community, is today a name to reckon with among the comity of Engineering Colleges in Kerala, making giant strides in all engineering branches and management studies. Toc H, a pioneer in education, serving as an active growth driver and home to a diverse community of innovators and entrepreneurs.
Toc H is affiliated with APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University (KTU) and approved by the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), New Delhi, and the Government of Kerala and, accredited by NAAC (National Assessment and Accreditation Council) with NBA (National Board of Accreditation) accredited programs (CE, CSE, ECE & ME) and ISO 9001:2015 Certification which ensure top-quality learning environment.

History of Toc H
Toc H International was founded during the First World War, by Rev. Tubby Clayton, an army Chaplain, in Poperinge, Belgium. Talbot House, as the house was called – or Toc H in signaler’s code for ‘T’ and ‘H’ – provided a haven of rest and refuge for the wounded and sick soldiers.

Toc H History
The Toc H movement in India began in Kochi in 1972. In the initial stages, it extended humanitarian and charitable services to leprosy and TB patients in various sanatoria and helped inmates of orphanages, mentally challenged children, and the down-trodden. Later on, Toc H entered the educational field and is presently running numerous schools and Toc H Institute Of Science & Technology, Arakunnam.We, at TIST, anticipate an educational environment that incorporates many novelties in the curriculum, within the University prescribed parameters. Interdisciplinary collaborations are encouraged in projects and the laboratories are equipped with ultra-modern amenities, to cater to the emerging needs of industries. Social commitment is met by offering scholarships to deserving, economically backward rural students. Creative content is given priority while adopting pedagogy models like Bloom’s Taxonomy and Creative Learning Process. The Quality of our learning environment got recognized when the college was accredited by NAAC – the only college at that time to get this honor under CUSAT. Our academic performance is excellent when compared to Government Colleges which have the advantage of subsidized education. Four B. Tech programs for TIST have NBA Accreditation (NBA 2018) a coveted achievement. This accredited status makes it possible for our students to get B. Tech(Hons.) degree to satisfy other eligibility conditions. TIST provides seven M.Tech programs, in addition to a full-time MBA program. An entirely new Research Wing has been established under the banner of: J.C. Bose Center for Research and Advanced Studies. The college has 15 researchers with Ph.D. research in areas like Thin Film Technology, LASER, Environmental Sciences, Energy Conservation, Waste Management, Electronics & Communication Engineering, Data Security, etc. A separate Department of Applied Psychology and Counseling-, a unique initiative- has been established to take care of the overall mental well-being of the students. The students are also encouraged to participate in sports and games such as basketball, football, cricket, tennis, and so on, for which extensive facilities have been provided. An in-door stadium takes care of such activities even during the monsoon. The college is now looking forward to synergizing the activities of all disciplines in order to motivate the students to cross the barriers perceived by many, namely seeking jobs, under the umbrella of their specialized branches. A sense of entrepreneurship is also instilled in the students by a separate wing fostering Creativity and Innovation, namely IEDC. The campus placement status of a batch that is just graduating is excellent with more than 360 more job offers, an increase of over 60%, compared to the previous years. There are several core companies like Ashok Leyland, Keynes Interconnection Systems, Cherytech India, Kwangjin India and so on which have placed our students. At the moment, TIST is incubating more productive engineers, researchers, and job creators than mere job seekers, in the advancing field of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Management studies.
